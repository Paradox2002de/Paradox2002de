Hello there,my name's Ezra and I'm 21 years old.
I'm from Germany,but I am fluid in English. 
I am a Santanist!
I love nature and 
everything that's connected to it. I'm an individual who enjoys making story's in my head and writing them down.

My Hobbys are hiking,crafting,sewing,fursuit building(currently waiting for more materials), reading and listening to music.

I'm a calm person and don't really give a damn about other people's opinions. I tend to keep things rational. If you're only here to troll and (or) attack my friends,you'll simple be hidden,since I do that freely.
