Hello there,my name's Ezra and I'm 21 years old.

I am a Santanist!
I love nature and 
everything that's connected to it. I'm an individual who enjoys making story's in my head and writing them down.

I'm a calm person and don't really give a damn about other people's opinions. I tend to keep things rational. If you're only here to troll and (or) attack my friends,you'll simple be hidden,since I do that freely.

My Hobbys are hiking,crafting,drawing,sewing,making clothes ,fursuit building(currently waiting for more materials), reading and listening to music. 
I mostly only wear black and dark toned clothes and i make them myself.
