oHello there,my name's Ezra and I'm 21 years old.
I'm originally from Germany but I am fluid in English. 
I am a Santanist!
I love nature and 
everything that's connected to it. I'm an individual who enjoys making story's in my head and writing them down.
My Hobbys are hiking,crafting,reading and 
listening to music.

I'm a calm person and don't really give a damn about other people's opinions. Yet I have a very strong opinion on some more sensitive topics,so be warned and don't be a snowflake please: -Neopronouns aren't valid in my opinion
